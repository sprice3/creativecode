# Clock

This is an clock I made with p5.js. The easiest way to see it in action is to copy the contents of [the javascript file](pastel-clock.js)  into a [p5.js editor](http://editor.p5js.org) and run it.

I got my idea for my clock based on The Coding Train's video. I liked how his clock looked in terms of shapes and layout goes but I didn't like the colors. I decided for my clock, I would want it to be something I would like looking at and matched my personality. That's why I went with the pastel colors. 

I also added an outline to my clock to give it the more "classic" clock look. I really based the look of my clock off of something I would like to be hung in my own house. I know it may seem simple but for someone who coding is still a foreign concept logically for me, I am very proud of how it turned out!!
