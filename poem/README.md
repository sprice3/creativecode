# Wonder

This project is a poem generator in Python. I started by creating an outline for my poem. 

Here is the outline:
"I wonder what it’s like to feel {} without feeling {}. Are you filled with a sense of {}? 

I wonder how it feels to be {} all the time. Is the world as {} as it seems? 

I wonder if we’ll ever all feel {}. Connected by this, not {}, together in it."

I then created a list of all of the word choices I would give Python to randomly select to fill in. I then assigned each word choice an abbreviation (ex: e1, e2, a1, etc.). From there I was able to construct the sentences and have Python generate the words for the blanks. 

It took me awhile to figure out how to get my poem generator to run successfully. It was a lot of trial and error but in the end I am pretty proud of what I came up with!

This script is about emotions and wondering about the different feelings a person can have. I didn't mean for the poem to be as deep as it ended up being but that what I ended up with. I think it probably had to do with the state of our world right now and everything going on in it. 

I think my poem is about someone who is battling with their inner emotions, trying to decide what they are feeling as well as evaluating what they feel compared to what others are feeling. By the end of the poem, they realize that emotions are what links everyone together and they are making a wish that everyone can unite together to feel this singular emotion to hopefully heal the world. 

I hope you enjoy my poem, Wonder.
