# Wonder

This project is a poem generator in Python. To see it run, download the ADD SCRIPT.  

This script is about emotions and wondering about the different feelings a person can have. I didn't mean for the poem to be as deep as it ended up being but that what I ended up with. I think it probably had to do with the state of our world right now and everything going on in it. 

I think my poem is about someone who is battling with thier inner emotions, trying to decide what they are feeling as well as evaluating what they feel compared to what others are feeling. By the end of the poem, they realize that emotions are what links everyone together and they are making a wish that everyone can unite together to feel this singluar emotion to hopefully heal the world. 

I hope you enjoy my poem, Wonder.
