# Bot Project

This bot, [@WatShouldUEat](https://twitter.com/WatShouldUEat), is meant to help you decide what you should eat. 

I chose to create my bot to help you decide what to eat for a few reasons. Firstly, I personally always struggle with deciding what I want to eat, so I figured other people probably do as well. Through this bot, I am helping myself and others who may also struggle with figuring out what to eat. Secondly, I thought this bot would be a good way for people to try new food combinations they never have before. It will open people up to new varieties and options for food (although I'm not sure most people will want to eat the crazy cominations of food my bot produces..). 

My bot is capable of producing a total number of 5,636,405,776 variations. 

Here is the formula I used to get this number: 

P(n, r) = n^r

P(274, 4) = 274^4

P(274, 4) = 5636405776

The bot is hosted at [Cheap Bots Done Quick](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com), so the code is a [Tracery](http://www.tracery.io/) grammar.
