# Netlfix Logo Bounce

This project is a "screensaver" that I created to replace the classic bouncing DVD logo. I thought since not many people watch DVDs anymore, it was time for a change. I decided to use the Netflix logo since I know many people have Netflix. I chose to do this code before I came onto GitHub and saw that the DVD bouncing logo was the example used so none of my code was taken from the example. I used [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j86zuqqTlQ&t=626s) videos to help me build my "screensaver". 

The purpose of my "screensaver" is for Netflix to use it whenever someone's screen is paused for a certain duration of time. 

The inspiration for this project is the classic [bouncing DVD logo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mGuCdlCcNM).
