# Glitch-Art Artist Summary 

For my revised Glitch Art project, I decided to try out another way to glitch! My orginal project, I focused on using Audacity and the Hex editor so for my improved glitch art, I decided to use tomato.py!

I went onto the GIPHY and I found two Office gifs (since it's my favorite show) and uploaded them into my Colab Notebook so I could glitch them!

I am super happy with how it turned out and was pleased with how easy it was to create them! 

I hope you enjoy my Glitch Office Gifs!
