# Screensaver Artist Statment

My screensaver is based on the idea that nowadays, people don't really watch DVDs but they do watch different streaming websites such as Netflix or Hulu. My orginal screensaver used the Netflix logo and had it bounce around to mimic the old DVD bouncing logo. But there were so problems with my old screensaver that I knew I wanted to fix with the new ones. 

The first thing I changed was the logo. This time, I went with the Hulu logo. I made sure to choose a logo that was a transparent .png in order to not run into any problems with where the logo bounced off from (as I was having with the previous screensaver). 

I also decided to take it a step further and try and see if I could change the color of the logo as it hit a wall. 

I think the improvements I made to my screensaver really make it better! If you want to see it, click [here](https://editor.p5js.org/sprice3/full/-GxluiSPw)
