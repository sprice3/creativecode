# Twitter Bot Artist Statement 
My Twitter bot, called @WatShouldUEat, is created to help you decide what food combinations you should eat! When I first heard what we had to do for our final portfolio, I knew I wanted to do something to make my Twitter bot even better!

And that's when I realized, I forgot the most important part of a meal: dessert!! That's when I decided that the one thing that could improve my bot would be adding code where it randomly generated a dessert for you to add along to your crazy food combinations. 

How I achieved this was by first, adding to the end of the origin sentence, "And for dessert, you should have #dessert#!" and then I went to the bottom of the code and listed out a bunch of different kinds of dessert. 

I think this addition to my bot really brought it all together and made the best improvement it could have!

If you ever can't decide what to eat, make sure to check out [@WatShouldUEat]https://twitter.com/WatShouldUEat) on Twitter!
