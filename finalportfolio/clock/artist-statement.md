# Clock Artist Statement 

For this re-desginment, I decided to combine two of the projects we did to create something more exciting for my clock! I decided to keep the colors and design I had from my orginal clock, but decided to bring in some elements from the screensaver project.

I found a .png image of a clock that I liked and uploaded into my code. And then putting in some code that I had already used for the screensaver project, I was able to insert a bouncing, color-changing clock behind the clock I created! 

I am super happy with the outcome and I feel like it brought my clock to the next level.
