# "All Is Lost"
## A novel by Sam Price (with the help of Python)

For the novel project, I used Python in a CollabNotebook to create my novel. I went with Method 2: Replacement Grammar, which uses Tracery's replacement grammar. I chose this method because it made the most sense to me. I was able to grasp it when we created our Twitter bots so I decided that using what I learned from a previous project to help me on this one would be the best way to go.

I attempted to have my novel be a horror novel. I was going for something along the lines of a murder and then someone trying to solve it and save more people. I was inspired by Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys and other classic detective novels like those. Although I'm sure after reading just the first paragraph of the novel I produced, you'd agree that the detective novels should be left to being written by actual novelists.

One thing that I found to be very useful in the process was generating a word count for my novel as I went along. I used this code to achieve the word count:

len(novel.split(" "))

This was something I picked up from Dr. Whalen in one of his many helpful tutorial videos. I was able to see how many words I had so I knew if I needed to add more or if I was able to take something away if I wanted to.

All that being said, I hope you enjoy my novel, "All Is Lost"!
